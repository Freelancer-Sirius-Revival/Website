	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
	Freelancer: Sirius Revival is a multiplayer-only modifaction for Freelancer. It overhauls the entire game with a strong focus on multiplayer (single-player being disabled).
	The mod's aim is to remain as lore-friendly as possible and only add content when necessary. The principle is to offer original content reworked primarily, to keep the original atmosphere of the game.
